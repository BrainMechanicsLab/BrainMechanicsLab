This repository contains a Python code that generates a cubic model of the brain using the Abaqus software. The code automates the process of creating a three-dimensional representation of the brain for further analysis and simulations.

Features
Automatically generates a cubic model of the brain suitable for Abaqus simulations.
Utilizes Python scripting capabilities to streamline the modeling process.
Provides flexibility to customize the dimensions and properties of the brain model.
Facilitates integration with Abaqus for subsequent mechanical analysis and simulations.
Requirements
Abaqus software installed on your system.
Python 3.x with necessary libraries (e.g., Abapy, NumPy, etc.).
Usage
Install the required libraries mentioned in the requirements.
Modify the code to adjust the dimensions and properties of the brain model as needed.
Run the Python script to generate the cubic model in the Abaqus format.
Import the generated model into Abaqus and perform further mechanical analysis or simulations.
